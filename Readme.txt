This program allows clients to connect to a server, input one word at a time the words they would like to get spell-checked, and the server will check a dictionary and tell the client whether the word is spelled correctly or not. The server will continue to expect words from a client until they enter the escape key and press return. The program
that enables the Networked Spell Checker is multithreaded. The threads are the main thread, worker threads, and log thread. Therefore, multiple clients can access the server at once and no data will be lost. Each time a word is entered, the word is returned followed by either "WORD CORRECT" or "NOT FOUND" based on whether the input was spelled correctly. When the server is run using "./spellchecker", the server can be accessed using the designated port number ‘5555’ I put in the main server thread.
